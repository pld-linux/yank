- Release 1.
- Updated to 0.2.1.
- Fixed source URI.
- Sorted and complete BuildRequires.
- Added subpackages with plugins (gpg, pgp5 and gtkspell).
- Removed obsolete plugin_dir patch.
- Added gconf_install patch (I'm not sure if it is OK).
- Added gtkspell_menu patch which fixes SEGV when displaying menu with
  "Other Possibilities".
  NOTE: I don't know how gconf works and it is possible that installation
  of gconf files is screwed.
